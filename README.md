# chad-santalo-regions
This repository contains the Java program that can display the Santalo Region of an
inputted 2-dimensional convex body, created by Chad Yu of Montgomery Blair High School.
The Santalo Regions, a notion of convex geometry first introduced by Elisabeth Werner and Mathieu Meyer, are defined to be the points "x" on the interior of a convex body such that the product of the volume of the body and the volume of the polar of the body translated by "x" are less than a certain value.
